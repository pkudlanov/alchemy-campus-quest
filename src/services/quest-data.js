        room. As if someones scratching their nails on a chalkboard. Peculiar 
        because there isn't a single chalkboard in all of Portland, Oregon.`,

            Turns out it was the canine earthling, gnawing on the metal
            leg of the recliner. As you approach to chase away the animal,
            the animal starts growling. You tell it to leave which makes it
            even angrier. It lunges at you, and clings on to your right
            pointer finger. You spill your coffee. All the school faculty is
            angry at you for agitating the thing. After a very serious board
            meeting it is decided the school will be better off without you.
            Your career is ruined because you don't have an education and
            now you can't even type anymore from the finger injury.`,
