                Turns out it was the canine earthling, gnawing on the metal
                leg of the recliner. As you approach to chase away the animal,
                the animal starts growling. You tell it to leave which makes it
                even angrier. It lunges at you, and clings on to your right
                pointer finger. You spill your coffee. All the school faculty is
                angry at you for agitating the thing. After a very serious board
                meeting it is decided the school will be better off without you.
                Your career is ruined because you don't have an education and
                now you can't even type anymore from the finger injury.
